# Luma Doctor Appointment Scheduling System

## Problem Definition

A busy hospital has a list of dates that a doctor is available to see patients. Their process is manual and error prone leading to overbooking. They also have a hard time visualizing all of the available time for a doctor for specific dates.

## Solution

This repository consists of a set of APIs to manage information about doctors, patients and their appointments

## How to configure mongoDB

The configuration file for `mongoDB` is at `/config/index.js`

There you can define the path to your mongoDB instance and also the credentials for that instance

## Steps to Run the Application

1. git clone the repository
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm start`

The application would start on `localhost` at port `3000`

## How to run unit test

Use `npm test` to start all the unit tests. Unit test would run on port `3001`

## How to use the APIs
